# 100daysData
- Experimenting with my own 100 day challenges.
- Spend at least 15 minutes a day learning something about data and post an update here.
- Notes can be a summary of what I learnt or main takeaways.
- Idea is to focus on data modelling, SQL, PostGres architecture, DyanmoDb
- Fingers crossed :)
