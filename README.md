# 100daysData
- Experimenting with my own 100 day challenges.
- Spend at least 15 minutes a day learning something about data and post an update here.
- Notes can be a summary of what I learnt or main takeaways.
- Idea is to focus on data modelling, ORM, SQL, PostGres architecture, DynamoDb
- Fingers crossed :) 

### Half way checkpoint
#### 50 Day mark
- Super happy I started to do this, was really helpful to solve a bunch of problems I encounter day-day.
- Will pause at 50 day mark for few days. Else, it'll get way too monotonous.
