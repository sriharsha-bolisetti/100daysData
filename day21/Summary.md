### What did I learn today?

- Some basic Postgresql. Finished first chapter of Art of Postgresql.
- Art of Postgresql is not comprehensive. I still have bunch of questions to figure out.
- Like, what is `WoW %` mean? why is the query using lag with partition is ordered?
- Anyway, not a bad start for figuring out some sql mess.
