### What did I learn today?

- SQL, lateral subqueries, rank() over partition, point datatype, GiST index, analyzing a complex sql query -> Top-N sorts, list of top 3 winners in every decade in f1db.
- I will definitely need to re-read this book or some other book to get good grasp of sql.
### Resources
